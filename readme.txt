### Configure scoring rules
To determine the sales readiness of leads, Manceppo offers lead
scoring functionality on both behavior and profile criteria.

Lead scoring is a way to measure the likeliness of a commercial
opportunity for a potential customer.

The lead scoring features in Manceppo include:

* Demographic (or explicit) scores based on specific profile characteristics that are generally available. Think of insight about buying authority, position or company size.
* Activity (or implicit) scores based on lead behavior such as website visits, email opens and white paper downloads.
* Multiple lead scores: when you sell multiple products or services, let’s say both CRM and ERP systems, Manceppo allows you to set up a lead score per product line or, even better, per area of interest.

To set up lead scores in Manceppo to MailChimp, just follow these 3
steps [here](https://manceppo.com/configuring-lead-scores-in-manceppo).
